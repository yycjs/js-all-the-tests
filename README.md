### JavaScript all the tests!

We are back from our summer break and this time things will be all about testing your JavaScript apps. We will talk about testing tools, mobile testing and debugging, writing unit tests and how to automate your tests.

This meetup will be split into two parts. The first half-hour will be about a beginner focussed topic and in the second part we will step it up a notch and do something more advanced. This time:

1) Testing tools

- Testing and debugging all browsers and mobile
- Frontend testing tools

2) Test automation

- Unit testing
- Automated functional testing
- Continuous integration
